        Kaija and I met in the fall of 2014. At the end of our first semester of grad school, we collaborated on this short film about Hansu, Kaija's aunt. We loved the process of engaging with the words that Hansu had written and coming up with ideas of how we would visually imagine them.  This experience sparked excitement about the possibility of continuing to share Hansu's stories through both her voice and animated visuals. This site explores Hansu's writing, voice, and vivid imagination through animated drawings created by Emily and sound design by Kaija. It also shares brief video snippets of Hansu's life in the assisted care facility she lives in, Amusings, in Vancouver, BC.
