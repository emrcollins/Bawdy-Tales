         A Little Bit About Hansu from Kaija Siirala, Hansu's Niece

         One of the first things you’ll notice about Hansu is that she knows how to turn a phrase. Often found with her nose in a book, a crossword on her lap, a flourescent post-it note with a query or observation on her side table, she is one of the biggest lovers of language that I know. If you like a good bit of word play to roll around your brain and then off your tongue, she makes for excellent company.  She is also hilarious. Astute, sharp in wit and tongue, curious and playful, the lens through which she looks and thinks about the world around her continually makes me pause, think, laugh - all such important human past times. Did I mention her delivery and timing? As part of a fairly tight knit family, I count myself lucky to be one of the recipients of her written musings in their varied form: letters, blog posts, emails. She often writes about her daily realities: the aches and pains of her body as it ages and changes, books, past and present family mythologies,  what it’s like living in a residential care facility, the people who care for her, the other people who live there, her visitors and the inevitability of the real estate developer who will change the daily reality of so many people when the facility is replaced with individual units and people are dispersed to alternate homes.  Hansu’s writing is so often an intimate, self reflexive look at what it’s like to be a human in the world and we’re excited to share a bit of it with you on this site.

         A Little About Emily and Kaija’s collaboration

         We met in the fall of 2014. At the end of our first semester of grad school, we collaborated on this short film about Hansu, Kaija's aunt. We loved the process of engaging with the words that Hansu had written and coming up with ideas of how we would visually imagine them.  This experience sparked excitement about the possibility of continuing to share Hansu's stories through both her voice and animated visuals. This site explores Hansu's writing, voice, and vivid imagination through animated drawings created by Emily and sound design by Kaija. It also shares brief video snippets of Hansu's life in the assisted care facility she lives in, Amusings, in Vancouver, BC.
